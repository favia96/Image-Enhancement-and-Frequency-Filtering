# Image Enhancement and Frequency Filtering

Project 1 - Image Processing (EQ2330) - Federico Favia & Yue Song, November 2019, KTH, Stockholm

This project in Matlab developed within the course of Image and Video Processing at KTH investigates different image enhancement and restoration techniques, namely contrast enhancement by histogram equalization, spatial domain smoothing, and image restoration in frequency domain (among the others Wiener filter). Both quantitative and qualitative analysis are conducted. See the report for more information.
